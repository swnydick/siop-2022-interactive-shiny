<h3><span style="color: #006550;"><strong>App 5 : Additional Features and Reactivity con't&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">App 5 will add several new features.&nbsp; For one, we'll add a new interactive mode to allow users to click on points that they are interested in and show data near the point of clicking.&nbsp; We'll also introduce a function to display a table in shiny. Lastly, we'll add the ability to see a trendline in the graph.</span></p>
